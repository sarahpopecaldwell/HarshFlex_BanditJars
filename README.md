Abstract

Human cognition is characterized by immense flexibility. Our extensive behavioral repertoire, which relies upon flexibly switching and accumulating strategies, allows us to adapt to, and thrive within, diverse ecological and social environments. At the same time, human behavior can also be remarkably rigid. We show a strong propensity for ‘sticking to what we know’—often foregoing even much better solutions in favor of familiar ones. How do we exhibit innovative and flexible behavior in some contexts, yet striking inflexibility in others? Here we tested the Constrained Flexibility Framework (CFF), a theoretical account of how variability, predictability, and harshness within decision-making environments shape cognitive flexibility. The CFF distinguishes between strategy-switching that occurs (1) away from a strategy that failed or is anticipated to fail, termed responsive flexibility, or (2) away from a working strategy, termed elective flexibility. The CFF asserts that high elective flexibility is mal-adaptive in stable or predictably variable environments, but may be very adaptive in unpredictable environments, so long as harshness is low. When harshness is high, the costs of elective flexibility are prohibitive. In this study, we provide supporting evidence for the CFF derived from 100 (57 female) English-speaking adult participants who completed an online, four-armed bandit decision-making task under four conditions: Stable Not Harsh, Stable Harsh, Variable Not Harsh, and Variable Harsh. In line with the CFF, we found that elective flexibility was suppressed in Stable Not Harsh, Stable Harsh, and Variable Harsh conditions compared to the Variable Not Harsh condition. The CFF provides a much-needed framework for understanding of how flexible behavior and cognition is shaped by dynamic environments. Our results provide support for the CFF and point to the need to study how human cognitive flexibility is adapted to diverse cultural and ecological contexts.
